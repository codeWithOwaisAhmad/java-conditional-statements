# If-Else Challenges in Java

This repository contains a collection of Java code snippets that demonstrate more advanced `if-else` concepts.

## Challenges

1. **Check if a number is within a certain range**: Write a method that takes a number and a range (defined by a minimum and maximum value) as input, and returns a string indicating whether the number is within the range or not.
2. **Check if a string contains a certain substring**: Write a method that takes a string and a substring as input, and returns a string indicating whether the string contains the substring or not.
3. **Check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age**: Write a method that takes a person's age as input, and returns a string indicating whether they are eligible to vote or not.
4. **Check if a triangle is valid based on its side lengths**: Write a method that takes the side lengths of a triangle as input, and returns a string indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply compile and run the `IfElseChallenges.java` file using a Java compiler and runtime environment (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
